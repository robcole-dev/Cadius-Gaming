# Cadius Gaming Community

Cadius Gaming is a site that is targeted to anyone that is into gaming or looking to get into gaming, that wants to join a community. The site gives an overview of games played and current staff. It also advertises servers currently being run by the Cadius Gaming Community staff.

Cadius Gaming is a start up community that was created by two individuals who played the game Space Engineers. So with this is mind the site was inspired and styled around space.
