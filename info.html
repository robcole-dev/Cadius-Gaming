            <p class="game-desc-left">Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. 
                Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), 
                pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, 
                there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, 
                volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. 
                The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.</p>

            <p class="game-right">Minecraft</p>
            <p class="game-desc-right">Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, 
                allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person 
                perspective. The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, 
                such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. 
                These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, 
                enabling them to build things.</p>

                PlayStation®5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S dedicated to aviation, armoured vehicles, and naval vessels from the early 20th century to the most

                an enemy warship with a torpedo from a fast attack boat.</p>
